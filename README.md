## Possible Improvements

**Features**:
- Count corrected mistakes
- More quotes from more movies
- Configurable typing duration
- 'Back'-buttons referring to previous screen
                                                                  
**Code**
- Better 'config' handling for Quotes

**Bugs**
- Sometimes the code crashes after pressing 'start'. Probably due to random quote selection.
